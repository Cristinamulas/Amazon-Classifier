# Predicting Amazon Reviews

## Goal
Build a classifier that predicts whether a review is negative or positive. This classifier would be trained on Amazon reviews for an APP called OverDrive.

## Data Collection
I scraped Amazon webside to get the reviews from an APP called OverDrive that is a librery for audio books and Ebooks. I wrote a scrip that internate over 200 pages for the Amazon site and extract the title, review, person who reviewed and the date when the review took place from this App. My data set contains 2388 reviews.
