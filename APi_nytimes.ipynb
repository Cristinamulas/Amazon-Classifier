Loosely based on &quot;3 Godfathers,&quot; John Ford\\'s maudlin 1948 western, this movie, a sweet fable of decency amid the down and out, also has echoes of Chaplin and Capra. Three homeless people \\\\u2014 an embittered alcoholic, a middle-aged transvestite and a teenage runaway \\\\u2014 find an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. As they try to reunite the foundling with her parents, they revisit their own unhappy lives, and travel through a city rendered with unbelievable precision and tinted with undeniable love. The potentially sticky sentiments of the story are balanced by a crazily inventive narrative and by Mr. Kon\\'s cool, obsessively detailed visual style. At the end, the skyscrapers of Tokyo wriggle and dance to a Japanese-language techno version of Beethoven\\'s &quot;Ode to Joy,&quot; which pretty much sums up this indescribable, unforgettable movie. \\\\u2014 A.

Loosely based on &quot;3 Godfathers,&quot; John Ford's maudlin 1948 western, this movie, a sweet fable of decency amid the down and out, also has echoes of Chaplin and Capra. Three homeless people — an embittered alcoholic, a middle-aged transvestite and a teenage runaway — find an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. As they try to reunite the foundling with her parents, they revisit their own unhappy lives, and travel through a city rendered with unbelievable precision and tinted with undeniable love. The potentially sticky sentiments of the story are balanced by a crazily inventive narrative and by Mr. Kon's cool, obsessively detailed visual style. At the end, the skyscrapers of Tokyo wriggle and dance to a Japanese-language techno version of Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy,&quot; which pretty much sums up this indescribable, unforgettable movie. — A.
