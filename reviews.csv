It does not seem to have the ability to order a series without knowing book names; you need to do library search first to get them. Also difficult to return books to library before due date. Had to go to library website to return them and even then Amazon site still had it available as not returned.

Annoying steps

It's very useful and convenient for borrowing materials. The 5 item limitation helps one to really choose what you read or listen to so one doesn't just tend to hoard a bunch of books one may ever read or not. My only complaint is that I chose an audible book only to learn after I'd downloaded it that the format wasn't compatible with my kindle. And there's no returning it until the due date. I just wish there could have been some kind of forwarning for this kind of situation. So now I have one less item I am able to choose until this un-useable item's date expires. I also tried downloading Overdrive on my laptop and the audio turned out to also be incompatible for some reason so I removed  it altogether from my laptop. Overdrive works just fine for e-books on my kindle, which by the way is 2013 hd (in case anyone else might have a similar experience).

I find this system too annoying to use on a consistent basis. Yes I did download a book on my kindle but the ones I really wanted were like 12 weeks out to download. Also, setting up the overdrive app is way beyond cumbersome. Nothing should be this complicated when one only wants to read a book from the library.

I enjoy reading adult mysteries on my Kindle while traveling.  My local library system was tied into Overdrive and it worked very well.  However, now that Overdrive is linked with Amazon, the choice for free adult mysteries like I used to get through my library is dismal.  I realize Amazon wants me to pay for downloading books rather than borrowing them, but I should still be able to get free adult mystery books through my library and I can't.  If you are going to be linked with libraries for people who use their Kindle like this, you should have a decent selection to choose from!  Needless to say, I will be having a discussion with my library as well.

Update: I spoke to my local library about this issue and they contacted overdrive about the issue. Overdrive has started that their app no longer works with the original Kindle Fire HD.I loved the app at first but then it updated and now I can't even log in. Whenever i get to the login page it gives me a connection error as shown above. If I click try again it does the same thithing. If I click cancel it closes the app to the initial page.

I bought a Kindle Fire after learning that my public library lends e-books through OverDrive. I attended a class for e-book users at the library during which they gave instructions for downloading and using OverDrive Media.At the beginning of the class, we were taken step-by-step through the process of downloading OverDrive to our e-book readers of various kinds . I followed along and did each step as directed, but we could never get the program to load. I tried to follow the subsequent instructions, but without the program, I was lost.After getting written steps from the library and several attempts at home, I was able to use it. I am enjoying being able to read books on my Kindle Fire when I can get them to load, but I have had difficulty each time I've tried to borrow a book.I appreciate that the program is free and that it offers many free books, but I struggle with using the OverDrive program.

Seems to work OK - just installed yesterday, had to figure out how to find local branch library, download a book, set it up to read in the app, pause and resume in another session.

I have overdrive on both my Kindle Fire and iPad.  Overrdrive is a great app, but returning audiobooks does not remove them from the ""Bookshelf"".  I have spend much time trying to remove them. The Tap n Hold method does not work on audiobooks?  I gave up, will let them expire and get my audiobooks from a different source. Removing the RETURN command when you download is a mistake that should be considered in the next update.  Leave the RETURN command in the Bookshelf to make it less of a chore to Return books early.

There was a slight learning curve with OverDrive when making selections from my local library, but I believe I'm getting the hang of it.  The player works well.  It has the ability to go back or forward in 15 second increments, which is very helpful.  These indicators were a bit difficult to see at first and they are very small. They're not the typical back and forward arrows, but circles with arrows with a small ""15S"" written inside. They are hard to work while driving.  I wish there was some sort of voice command available to do this instead of using a finger.

I've been using the website for a while now and I picked this up thinking it might streamline the process of getting books a little. I only used the app for a few minutes before determining it is just a reader and browser. I am not sure if kindle can read other book formats as I have never has a reason to find out. I have yet to find one book my library has on overdrive that they do not have the kindle version available which works great for kindle (shocking right?). The download process for kindle books through this app is exactly the same as when I use fire's browser. Also the site it takes you to for finding books is exactly the same as the one in a regular browser and it's browser is slower than the native one on the same connection. I did not use the reader at all before determining the app is unnecessary because why would I want to use a third party reader on my kindle? Also the app even complicates the process a bit by requiring an account with oveedrive or facebook to use which isn't the case if I just use the browser link I got off my librairy's website months ago. The ap isn't poorly made (based on my 10 minutes use of it) which is why I didn't give it one star, it's just useless.

Now I wonder if that is true. I thought I would have it in my Kindle until I had to return it, like a regular book from a library. I worry that Overdrive is going to make me purchase it.

I love being able to read FREE ebooks from my local library on my kindle. However, the biggest issue I have is when I read the book ""in the browser"" it is very difficult to go back a page.

This app came up when I was looking here on Amazon for an app that would allow me to open and read epub files I obtain on my own on my Kindle Fire 1st generation.This foolish app requires that you connect with LIBRARIES to see what they have to offer.  Can't see any way to open epub files you already have on your device.I blame Amazon for doing such a poor job in providing help for owners of their Kindle Fire and other Kindle devices.I even tried to get into a ""chat"" thru amazon.com with one of their reps to ask for an app that'd do the job.  I immediately, somehow, was no longer connected to the Amazon rep.I'm guessing maybe they don't want you to be able to read your own stuff, only what you buy thru them.It's also pretty odd that you do a search here for Kindle apps, and stuff comes up that doesn't do what you're looking for, and even apps that'll work on other Android devices, but NOT on an Amazon Kindle.Do a lot of research into what this app is before you buy it.  It may not be what you're looking for.  Don't get stuck like I did.

Over drive is just not as user friendly as Audible.

It is odd that it downloads in so many parts. Just when you think you're finished, it downloads another part.

But when I added up all the bottom parts they didn't add up to the total time of how long the book was. On one book, it took me forever to download it. Probably the way to go is not to download it, but just start listening & download just a little at a time. I guess that will work; I haven't tried it.

Living in a woodsy rural area, wireless connection is not strong enough to access Internet and spent 3 days trying to get a book from Library to Kindle Fire HDX. This APP did download overnight, but can't get to Internet to retrieve book at Library. Also downloaded APP separately to ""Cloud"" - it is in Cloud on Kindle Fire, but not at Amazon site Cloud content.  I thought I could access the book indirectly there. Copy of downloaded Audiobook is on PC (as a ODM file when I asked for MP3). If another 24 hours helps get the book into Amazon's Cloud and I can get it on the Kindle Fire HDX, I will make an update. I really appreciate all feedback people leave because that seems to be the only way to find out how to get new stuff to work. As an old-timer and Amazon Prime member, I've had Kindles since original, and now keep a 6"" reader besides Fire HDX (minus Internet connectivity), and yes I also have the APP that increases wireless connection. I gave this APP 3 stars because it's on the Kindle OK, but can't reach the Internet to see if it works to get audiobook.UPDATE: You have to download the OverDrive APP onto computer if wireless not feasible. My library had a ""Software"" section in their Audiobook menu that gave options to download OverDrive to either a device or to PC. AHA - Audiobook is on computer so I downloaded and installed OverDrive there. Then I dragged the audiobook file onto OverDrive shortcut on my PC desktop and WaLah! There is the book in several sections - MP3 format.Connected Kindle back to computer and this time all folders showed up by selecting ""Explore"" rather than ""Open"". Tsk tsk Dummy Me. OK - copied and pasted Part 1 of book into several different folders (good thing) - it does NOT show up in ""Audio"" folder, but does show up in ""Music"" after a hard 20-second reboot and Sync - not before. It has sound and works!!!! I stopped there but it may also be in Doc folder.Hope there is a clue that will help somebody - like all other comments have helped me. Good Luck and Good Reading (or listening)!

Then when I retyped the pasword, it said, csomeone already has that password, so it must have been correct.  Then I had to go down to the library and they helped me.  They had to end up calling to California about the password, and there was a 20 minute wait, which tells me I am not the only one who has problems getting in.Once I got in, I found lists of books I had already read.

(My child checks out the book on her account)THEN go into the child's device, SWITCH to the Adult's profile and then go to SETTINGS.Select the child profile and then choose ADD CONTENT.Select the books you wish to share and then at the bottom of the screen, hit the DONE button.Switch back to the kid's profile, turn on the wireless and then the books should download.As for the ADULT profile, you don't need the app. Just borrow the book and send it to your device. Make sure the wireless is on and it will show up on the device.The only problem I had with borrowing books (for myself) was that if you wish to renew it, for some reason Kindle thinks it's still expired and won't let you read it again. The work around for that is to return the book, wait a few days and then borrow it again.

If I had a choice of another place to download books from my library I would use it. Unfortunately, OverDrive seems to have an exclusive.

Tried going back to using my computer directly and the same sad result. Called May Day and they didn't have a clue and said it was a problem with the public library.  Went further and called tech support and they were even less helpful.Removed the app - and my books magically re-appeared as available and I downloaded through my computer.  There seems to be something screwing up between the app and my computer which negates the ability of either to function.  Too bad, it would have been simpler to just use the Kindle.If they can get this fixed this app would be nice, the Overdrive system is wonderful for readers who love their library!

Definitely not worth the money and time and effort! should only use this when the product really does not reflect the product listing. If there are any positives at all to the product or its use, you should not give it 1 star.2 Stars (I don't like it.): The product is not exactly as described, either appearance-wise or functionally. The product may still be usable but it’s very different to what was described. The product may have a few faults. I'm not a fan of this item as it is no where close to my expectations and I won't order it again, but I can imagine a few others might find it functional as it has at least one positive quality.3 Stars (It's okay): This item has both positive and negative qualities. I can definitely see some people loving or liking it as it may work for them, but I would likely not purchase in future. While you might think a 3-star score equates to average, 3 stars counts against the product as a negative score. So if you’re not meaning to give it a negative score, rethink your 3-star rating!4 Stars (I like it): The product is as described and functions well. There may be a few minor issues, but all in all, the product is solid. This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this, but is a good product overall. I would use this item.5 Stars (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product. product is amazing! You love it! This is the highest of the highs. If you would recommend it to your friends, family — it’s definitely a 5-star score. Be unbiased here; if the product is exactly as described and meets expectations, but the product isn’t your personal favorite, it could still be 5 stars.If you found this review in any way HELPFUL, PLEASE VOTE YES!!!

So, searching for audiobooks, the two of us would see a title pop up in the search results or in the genre sections that was unavailable as an audiobook, despite being set to only show audio options.While the book selection is moderate, as might be expected, every other aspect of this Library App was found lacking.

Overdrive is so much more difficult to use and to be able to access the books, you have to be able to access the internet.

My kids can use the Libby app with no problem.  You do have the option to download as Kindle books which is great for my older child who reads, but my younger child who likes to sit and have the tablet read to him as it highlights his words to learn to read better cannot access the books that way and most of his books are not available on Kindle version

Although I have not changed my password, overdrive keeps telling me that I am submitting an incorrect password.  It is so frustrating, that I have given up on using it at all.

We've lost a couple of chapters because of this glitch. When going back into the story, it opens one page before or one page after, depending on the orientation it was when you closed the app and opened it up again. If you open the book in the same orientation, then you're on the right page.When setting options, after setting one, the menu closes and you have to open the menu again to set the next one. You should be able to set all the options and then tap ""Done"" to exit the menu.Brightness is supposed to be able to use the default device brightness but it doesn't. It always brighter than what I have set the Kindle Fire for. Not good in a dim ambient light situation!I do like the little window that pops up when you tap in the center of the screen which tells you which chapter you're in and how many pages you've read of the chapter.

This app does provide you access to both ebooks and audio books, and I love that it allows me to get access to books I want to read/listen to without having to go to the physical library building.  However, the user interface is a complete mess.  Navigating between libraries is completely confusing.  It isn't clear if I'm checking stuff out from my local library, or from some global OverDrive library.  I have books listed when I visit my account, but clicking on books to try to, say, return a book early may simply take you to an info page about the book.  There are multiple places to view what is on your ""bookshelf"" and usually one is empty while the other has the books from your library.  But sometimes your books are listed in both places!  It isn't clear why, and no all functionality is available in all places.  Sad thing is, they know the UI is bad, and provide links inside the apps to help steps (that may or may not work) to do things like returning books.As this is the only place to checkout online materials for my local library, I'm stuck using the app.  Again, I love that I'm able to check these resources out, and continue to use this app regularly.  It just seems like, with a little effort, this could be a much better app.

There's a lot to like about this app.  I downloaded it to get MP3 audio books onto my Kindle and iPod Touch and it works very nicely.  In fact, downloading audio books onto my iPod via OverDrive is many times quicker than uploading books on CD into iTunes ... and I think the file sizes are MUCH smaller using OverDrive than using iTunes. The sound quality is good, the search feature is OK and moving around the app is pretty easy.  My biggest problem with OverDrive is probably more a function of the libraries providing the material.  There are very few non-fiction audio-books available to me through my library.  I can go and take out the same book on CD from our library but almost all the titles I find in our library system are unavailable through the OverDrive system. So, in the past with the CDs, I chose what I wanted to read.  With OverDrive, I choose what's available, not necessarily what I want.  Non-fiction is much less of a problem since they offer many titles from many authors.  Science and history audio books are much more scarce.  Regardless of genre, downloadable e-books (not audio books) are relatively plentiful.  Of course, for the price (free), it's a decent deal no matter what or how you read!

Yeah, I know it's free and I know you don't have a choice and I know libraries can't afford to pay more for it, but...It is not easy to keep your place in audiobooks. Also you do not have a good choice of speeds for audiobooks. It's 1.0X or 1.2X, etc. Depending on the reading speed of the narrator I usually prefer to speed up to 1.1X or 1.15X  For me it was either too fast or too slow. It doesn't have a car mode. Chapters should be right there on the main screen instead of buried in a menu.The interface is way too simple. It really needs to be updated. The developers should take some hints from Audible's app, which has a much more user friendly and elegant interface. It's too bad we can't borrow library audiobooks in Audible format the way we can borrow library books in Kindle format. Three stars only because it's free and public libraries are a wonderful thing.

In the past I've used this app so often that I have my library card number memorized and loved it. I used it on both my Android phone and my Kindle Fire HD.  Within the last 3 weeks something has changed and I am no longer able to even sign into my account. When I try to sign in the [select library] window will not drop down to give me a list of libraries to choose from or allow me to type in my library name. This happens on both my Kindle and my Android.I can log into my account if I use a browser but not the application. I've tried leaving feedback on the app, emailing androidcontact@overdrive.com and calling Amazon App Store. I've received no help with this issue. The Amazon App Store made me explain the issue to 3 different people who all required me to tell them the issue over and over again. Wasted a whole lunch break on the phone with them for no reason. They still have no idea what the problem is as far as I can tell. The support staff just didn't listen to what I was saying.

This is a great idea for an app.  There are many titles at my public library which are not in Kindle format or require a download.  It seems all titles are available via ePub format, so this should be a slam dunk app given the number of books I read from the library.The good: It works.  You can browse relatively easily.  The books show up and are readily available to read.The bad:  It's slow - the page turns, the lag time for browsing, and especially the chapter changes.  The fonts are awful.  A little effort could provide a font that is much easier to read.  It's 2013 for crying out loud - that stuff has been figured out for years.  The integration / browsing / checkout experience leaves a lot to be desired.  It's entirely possible to remember my 15 digit library card number so I don't have to dig it out each time I want to use it.If OverDrive decides to do this right, this can become a killer app on my Kindle Fire, until then... ehh.

Finally, after spending over 30 minutes on the process, I thought I was almost there, ready to enter my library card number, and BAM!--something happened and the book which said it downloaded on my Kindle never appeared!  I didn't have any more time to spend on it at that point, so I just went ahead and purchased the book on my Kindle--maybe that was your plan all along---I've never had any problem doing that!

I'm tempted to give this app only one star, but since it's always been stable when I've used it, that deserves some credit. Stability is about the only thing this app has going for it. The search feature really, really sucks dirt. In many instances, even if you type in the title or authors name correctly, it may not pull up what you're looking for. And searching for an author whose first name are initials, forget it.  On average, it takes 4-5 attempts to find what I'm looking for.  If I actually find it. To see the synopsis of a book takes multiple clicks, also very frustrating and time consuming. Especially on devices that have limited data plans.There's supposed to be an updated version coming out soon. Since making it worse is almost mathematically impossible, I'm looking forward to the new version.

I subscribe to several libraries. I was a bit annoyed that one of them started using OverDrive. It does require an extra step every time to read on the phone with the Kindle app, but not on the Kindle. It lacks a dictionary which I find disappointing as if I want to check something about a word now I have to go to a dictionary on line or at home which takes too much time away from the reading. It was a bit gitchy to download and took several tries for one of my devices even after wading through doing it on the first device. You can bookmark and while I have done that I have yet to go back and see if it works with the same ease as the Kindle app. I must say I will be trying to use the one library that requires OverDrive less and less and it is just not as easy to use and I do plan to make a comment to the library. All that said it is better than no ebook access from that library at all.

This is the worst app ever. Full of  bugs and loops that bring you back to start so you have to enter and reenter your library card. The help option  goes directly to the local library, and in my case, it's a contact to another library and that staff member left 2 years ago. So essentially there's no help unless you want to go to the libary - this app has never taken the user in mind- or works for the purpose of increasing reading of books at the local level. You might as well go back to the library.  Does anyone or has anyone ever had the opportunity to tell these developers how awful this program is? Less than one star. The only option for this 'service', this is a non service for all the time it takes to  make it work. Maybe the idea is to make you buy the books...too bad this program is so bad and non supportive.

This is a fairly good app if you're an epup user like me.  It still frustrates me that the kindle reader still does not support epup thus forcing me to convert epups into a format that kindle will open.  But I will remain sonewhat hopeful that kindle will find a way to incorporate that format at some point.  In the meantime, there is Overdrive which does okay when it comes to epups.  What I find irksome though is when tapping on a hyperlink to temporarily read another section of the book, there is no clear way to return to where you were before.  You have to go to the beginning of the chapter and swipe from there.  Kind of a time waster.  And there is no option to highlight text.  Unless there is and I am not looking in the right spot.  All in all an okay app to read epups but without some features it could really use.

While you can check out a Kindle Book on this app, returning is a pain in the neck. It also doesn’t sync with the library books that I checked out with Libby which is Overdrive’s App that is available and used on all the other platforms. There is a Android Libby App but Amazon will not make it available on their store. I prefer Libby as it is so much more intuitive.  It still lets you send a book to your Kindle App but you aren’t force to like you are with this app if you want to read offline.  Libby, unlike this app, allows you to see all the books in a series in order.  I contacted Amazon to ask why not available and their response was yes it is not available and please make suggest to make it available. Since Libby has been available on the Andriod platform  , I don’t know why the Kindle Fire Tablets are the only on e reader  can’t have it.  The lack of this app has made my Kindle Fire essentially a doorstop.

Great idea, BUT. The UI for this is terrible. Every time you open the app you have to reselect your library from a huge list. It doesn't remember the user, let alone what library they are a patron of. When I can find a book here, I'll use it. But it is my last resort.

I think this app is worthy of 3 stars.  I was delighted to find out that I could access a 'digital' library and borrow books.  It looked very promising.  However, I am allowed to have the book for only 7 days.  I guess I am a slow reader.. but if I start reading a book with hundreds of pages, I am not going to complete the book in 7 days.  My library's server was down for a couple of days, recently, and I was not able to access the book I had borrowed... and was told by my library's web person that OverDrive would not allow more than 7 days from when I received the book to when they took it back.  I hunt and peck every time I want to access my book or my library... to me it is not straight forward.  I am however, appreciative of this app, I will certainly be using it in the future.

Login's can be EXTREMELY tedious but that's probably more a function of the partner than Overdrive. On my Android devices it works flawlessly once I'm logged in. On my Kindle, not so much. The problem is Amazon's proprietary OS that basically locks you almost exclusively into Amazon offerings. Most of the time that's not an issue but the gaps in the product line and the CONSTANT up-selling gets old. I guess that's the trade-off for for a subsidized, branded device.

When is the rental before mine expire? When does my rental expire? These are all things that either do not exist in the app or they are so hard to find that it is like they don't exist. Also there are symbols which I interpret to mean ""text book"" and ""audio book,"" but there is no key to help you figure out what everything means.

But this ""New and improved"" design and app have made this services entirely unusable. Searching for books is rendered useless. You search and it just buffers continuously. Seriously, I let it buffer for over 20 minutes more than once. It never actually shows the results. It says to contact your library if there are issues. I'm a member of several libraries and none of those work either. Contact the libraries and they can't do any trouble shooting on their end. This is clearly a design flaw/bug in the app itself.

OverDrive itself has always been good.  Unfortunately, I can only give it 3 stars because of the horrible, complicated and confusing manner in which the Libraries now employ it.  It used to be you signed into your local library, downloaded OverDrive (if you didn't have it), and checked out your book.  Now one has to go through multiple sign-ins--your local library, OverDrive, and Amazon just to download a book!  I'm still not sure if I will ever find the starting sign-in page again to download another book in the future--despite bookmarking what I think was the starting page.  Why make something that was so simple, so complicated?  I used to find and download books in minutes.  Now it takes me an hour--IF everything go OK and all the sign-ins work.

While I love being able to download library books straight to my Kindle, I don't love the format for doing it. The app is clunky at best, with no good way to get to any one page. It takes a few steps to get to your loans, and not all of them show up. Sometimes it makes me go through the whole process of adding my library even though I've done it several times before.New apps are coming out that provide the same service, and from what I've seen they're more user-friendly.

When it works, this app is a wonderful way of checking out e-books via your local library.  I have it on my iPad, where it's never given me a moment's trouble.  On the Kindle Fire, however, if you're trying to check an e-book out as a Kindle book, there are lots of pitfalls.  The download often isn't automatic, as the screen directions imply - quite often I've found that I have to go into ""Manage Your Kindle"" and re-download the book.  Sometimes, it just won't download the Kindle book version to the Kindle Fire at all.I have not found these problems to be the case when downloading the book as an Adobe file to the Kindle Fire.  My advice is to stick with that - unfortunately, once you've chosen one format or the other at the Download page, you can't go back.

Well, it's free and eventually it works.  And it's absolutely mandatory for many audiobook library downloads.  So it's arguably a really good deal.  Unfortunately, it's really awkward to use and set up.  Lots of going back and forth signing into my online library account to get information, and creating an overdrive account and getting that synced to my library account.  Has trouble understanding that all the branches of my library are really the same library.  Insists that I choose one of them as my library.  Insists that I log in using my library card number instead of the login id I normally used to log in to my library account.  Something is messed up with the choice of download formats from my library because if I choose .mp3, which is my only choice, nothing downloads and I get sent to the overdrive web site.  But after waiting a while, I can run the overdrive app, log in to my library from there, and find my book in the checked out books list.  It would be nice if there were some alternatives, but there aren't.

The former version of this app functioned perfectly. However, since it updated itself, it has permission of prevent my Kindle from shutting down. Thus rendering the sleep timer useless.

I must be missing something.  I ordered this app because I thought I could listen to audio books borrowed from local library (on my Kindle Fire).  I can't get it to work.  I just seem to have a useless app.  I suspect I am failing to do something right; but I don't know what that is.  I have Overdrive Media Console on my laptop and love it.  I just hate having to carry my laptop around from place to place when I want to listen to an audio book.  I had hoped that downloading it to my Kindle would make it easier for me.  I am 67 years old so it could well be that I am not as technologically savvy as the young folks.  My rating of 1 star should not be deemed an adverse reflection on the app.

The site is extremely difficult to use! The coordination with the library site is virtually non-exsistant. Over drive does not offer any way to search by category or to select from the library list once on the overdrive page. There is NO DOWNLOAD OR SELECT BUTTON ON THE OVERDRIVE PAGE. I would expect that overdrive would simply expidite the use of the library site, instead it intrudes itself and separates the user from the library and isolates the user from author and category search sites on the library pages. Why can't I simply go to the library website ,select a book after a search and if available down load the book. Why am I diverted to Overdrive where-Like a hamster in a cage I run in circles trying to get theG*****N book?

I have never had an e-reader before, but I am very familiar with computer programs and consider myself to be somewhat savvy in the use of technology.  I am an avid reader and listener of audio books, so I decided to purchase a kindle for myself for Christmas.  I have now listened to one audio book and have read two e-books and have successfully returned them.  (Surprisingly enough, the return process is not intuitively obvious if you want to return an item before its due date.)  My library allows 3 items checked out at once, and I currently have 2 audio books and one e-book on my ""bookshelf.""  I finished one of the audio books, but I can't figure out how to return it before the rental expires in 5 days.  Also, I have been unable to figure out how to switch between the audio book that I have not yet read and the e-book that I am currently reading.  I like to listen to audio books while working, and read the e-books when sitting to relax.  I cannot get the audio book to open, and I can't find any directions on the OverDrive website to activate it, since there is no ""button"" to select ""read"" or ""play"" like there is on the e-book.  I suppose that I will have to finish the e-book and return it to be able to access the audio book, which I find strange.  Why have the ability to check out more than one item if you can only access one at a time?I'm sure that the software works well if you understand the process, but I have wasted several hours trying to learn it on my own.  For that reason, I give it a poor rating.

This works beautifully on my Android cell phone, horribly on the FIRE. When I contacted customer service they said that I should ask the library for help. Books checked out at the library send you to an Amazon page, requiring your email / customer sign in and password unless you want the world to have access to your one-click checkout. You have to have it sent to your FIRE tablet and it doesn't load in the Overdrive bookshelf but on the normal FIRE books screen. When you click on the library in OverDrive App you get a white page forcing you to go to the library through the browser and sign in. NOT CONVENIENT. CLUNKY.

I use this with my local library card to borrow books from the library for my i-pad. Daughter recently got it to do the same for her kindle. Some of it is not very intuitive, but once it is set up, and you have used it a few times, it makes sense. I wish that my daughter had it figured out. She is very confused by the interface, and having to go from bookbag to bookshelf does not make sense to her. So, a 4 from me, and a 3 from her. She is twelve, and tech savvy, so it must be the kindle procedure that has her annoyed. I would give 3.5 stars, but that is not an option.

I got this app because my library partners with Overdrive, then I find that the library book I ordered was an ebook PDF and Overdrive doesn't support it.  Then I couldn't even read the book through Adobe Digital Editions and my libraries helpdesk deferred to Overdrive technical support.  It was by email and they promise a response within 8 business hours or 24 hours on weekends.  They took all of that and more every time and the responses were so brief that I had to go back and forth for days to get the answers to simple questions.

The ""new"" version of the Overdrive Media Console is a visual improvement over its predecessor, but still is clunky and, obviously, not intended for use on smaller tablet devices or smartphones because its display does not fit well on the display realestate and requesting layout changes requires signaling its host which can involve lengthy delays on some connections. Considering its bloated size, the app code really doesn't do much. There should have been as much time spent on the process functtions as there was on the display functions... then I might have been a happier User.Update: I have now uninstalled this app. I am too old to put up with crap!

I don't want to have to restart my Kindle every time I want to read a book, and only be able to read it in browser (wi-fi mode). The app is useless as it is currently working.

It does its job in getting library books for free, however, once you leave the selection screen it gets very challenging. Navigating the app is difficult and using the app is not much better.  At times it interfaces with Amazon automatically and you end up downloading from there rather than from the Bookshelf.  The bookshelf which is the main download function is quirky and the downloads are slow when compared to Amazon/Audible. Also, it oftentimes sends you back to what seems to be a main library site home page and you again have to choose books, music etc. If you searched for an audiobook and download it, when you go back to your search you are on page 1 of the Electronic Book search. It doesn't go back to where you left off.

The reason for this rating is because I find it difficult to use @ times. It may be because I am not very familiar with using apps. The frustration is that even my librarian is unable to tell me how to return books until  the due date, which prevents me from adding new books since there is a limit. She tells me it is due to my Kindle as she has an I-Pad and it gives her a button to return the book. I have requested help but so far have not had an answer.

Has anyone read their disclaimer? I don't think so. You take all of the risks and give up your identity - While 'OverDrive, Inc..' takes none of the responsibility or liability. No wonder they disabled the old program, with its direct library interface, from the new Amazon Fire. How much crap can the gullible swallow before their heads explode? Five Star? Free? Nope! It _will_ cost you (in box-car size letters) your identity.Solution: Take you time - Download media into a secure system from reliable sources - Scan that media to insure its integrity, then upload your MP4 and MP3 data to your Fire over a secured network. This eliminates the user-installed man-in-the-middle attack.

As a frequent borrower at my local library I was thrilled to find I had access to e books on my kindle fire. Overdrive downloaded easily and the instructions were fine. My frustration is in the lack of order in the book titles. There appears to be no rhyme or reason in the listings. Books and authors are in totally random order which means you have to trawl through the whole lot to find something that appeals. Very frustrating. Not sure I will persist.

I was really disappointed in this app on my Kindle Fire.  I have been using OverDrive through my regular library web site for quite a while, and it works fine.  The Kindle app was hard to use; it initially showed only a handful of books; it sent four requests to my e-mail to verify my account (which I did each time).  When I finally was able to locate a book that I wanted to read, I had to complete the download through the regular web site, even after I had asked to borrow the book via the Kindle app.  I feel compelled to mention that I am very proficient with computers and electronic devices.  Others seem to like this app, but they may be using it on another device or know a secret that I don't.

This app worked great on my Kindle Fire for the first week or so. Now I can't access my account at all & a book I had been reading for the last 5 days became""invalid"" all of a sudden & had to be deleted. Log in doesn't work on the app & there is no support that I can find online because when I try to access the website, I get a message that the page has been removed. I hope they fix it soon because when it did work, it was great (except for a problem with returning me back to the last page read...it would instead return me to several chapters back).

Terrible, terrible app. I had used it for for years with my Iphones, with no problems, but then they did a ""upgrade"". Honesty, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Now, in the middle of listening to a library audiobook, over and over again, the program has crashed.  You would think that I could just reboot my Iphone and it would start working again. Right? The only way to fix this problem is to uninstall Overdrive and do a re-install. However, that causes the loss of ALL of my downloaded audio books.  Online, they give you a list of fixes - I have tried them all to no avail.  I called my library - don't bother - they can't help you. The librarian told me they started having problem with Overdrive when they did the ""upgrade"". In fact, they were the ones that suggested I ""give Overdrive a bad review"". They are frustrated, too.  Sadly, Overdrive is the only program of its kind available through my libraries.

Overdrive says date and time on kindle are probably wrong- no they are not. Then said to clear cache. Didn't work nor did restarting. As I said, what did work was uninstalling and reinstalling the app.

There is so much ""friction"" within the library e-book hold and checkout procedure that I'm very discouraged by the whole thing. The arbitrary constraints and limits seem capricious until Amazon and others remind us that it isn't about encouraging library use. Friction used to occur naturally, as when waiting for the bookmobile to make the rounds. Oh them was the days!

I MUST use Overdrive because an error occurs anytime I try to download a library selection directly to my Kindle. Error message says that Amazon is working on the problem but it has happened for so long I don't believe they really are. I would prefer more ease and ability to highlight, note and bookmark. Maybe I just haven't been using Overdrive long enough to know what I'm doing.

I haven't had any problems with the app, however, I find the book selection limited and frustrating when waiting for a high profile book. Check outs are for three weeks only, which makes reading a long book difficult and unenjoyable-- you have to just get through it instead of taking your time. Books that have been on hold are typically released around the time you're in the middle of reading another book, which makes the reading process even more rushed. Maybe this is an issue with my library's selection, but will probably only use this app for lower profile books or finding a new author or book series.

This site is not user friendly at all. It is very difficult to navigate, and both my husband and I are experienced users. In addistion to the poor website, we had a couple of specific issues with Overdrive. In one case, only a sample of the book (30 pages) downloaded when we ordered the copy. We worked extensively with THREE library employees over a couple of days and never had success getting that particular book. When I tried to return a copy of a completed book yesterday, I was never given the opportunity. Where the heck is the ""return book"" button?? Not on my bookshelf where one would expect to find it, beside the book itself. Never did find it...the library will have to take it beack when my 14 days are up. Very frustrating.

Could only do the listen step while near wi-fi (none available on the train).  Never did get the option to return it to the library but I think they take it back automatically once the time expires. Unfortunately our library only loans audiobooks through this service so there's nothing to be done about it.

I would give all the stars but the overdrive on a Kindle is a curious thing. It seems that the borrowing of material from the public library is disabled?Maybe because AMAZON does not want readers to read anything loaned from the public library. There is no problem with content obtained from the AMAZON just borrowed content from elsewhere. I am thinking of giving up my Kindle and using something else to read e-books. AMAZON may have lost or never obtained me as a customer for reading material because of this. The walled-garden model of business is good for the bottom line but can be dangerous in a society where both commerce and the exchange of ideas are free.

This software works well, but needs some tweaking.  Once I download an ebook to my tablet, I'd like to be able to organize my ebooks on bookshelves under different subjects.

Sorry, but this is probably the most user unfriendly app I've tried to use. It's confusing, awkward and difficult.

Each try has resulted in a trip to the library to have one of the staff, who do know it well but also have some degree of difficulty as a user, to help me wade through the cryptic messages and awkward flow. I'm sure the programers can't understand what the problem is, and maybe it's the result of generational issues, but it doesn't work for me.

I have read the first two books of this series and was excited to read this third book in the series.  I was looking forward to reading a good, clean mystery, with Christian values.  However, the protagonist, Callie, really disappointed me.  She found fault in everyone, but herself.  I have seen her err on more than one occasion, but I found her to be rigid, cold, callous, and unfeeling in her initial judgments of Luisa and Ellen and responses to them in different situations.  I was not thrilled about her in-laws either.  When someone in lower socioeconomic circumstances has problems, it must automatically be something that person is doing wrong and bringing it upon him or herself?  When someone makes an innocent mistake we just automatically punish?Has anyone read the Book of Job lately?We are supposed to be in the world not of it and the Grace that is given to us is supposed to be passed on to others.Again, I was thoroughly disappointed.

I've lost the ability to stream radio and other online media and I was hoping that at the least I could listen to books during the work day.I tried it again and this time I downloaded the app directly from the Amazon App Store and it worked! Can't remember how I downloaded it the first time, maybe through my library's link to Overdrive, but it's my suggestion that you download it from the Amazon App Store. I then downloaded a book, seemed to be quite fast even on WI-FI. It was a bit confusing navigating Overdrive on the Kindle HD at first but I think I have the hang of it now.

"

I downloaded the app thinking I would derive the same benefit as I would have had I visited my public library.  If a book is a bestseller, I have always been able to wait however long until the book isavailable to borrow.I wanted to borrow a book by David Balducci who seems to be quite prolific inhis writings.  I have never read him and just wanted to try a new author.  I wassurprised to find that I could not samplehis new book to see what his books haveto say/offer a new reader.The sample was more gimic than anything else which spoke to me as, "" I am a hot shot writer; you can buy book"". That's nit my public library. To be a patron of the library means that you value everything about books and are willing to donate time and dollars to see that, that institution continues not just to survive but thrive.I gave OverDrive two stars. One star for perpetuating a prolific writer and hi s quest to make more money and another for just being out there for somebody.

Generally well written.  The plot and characters are reasonably well developed, though not all of them are evenly treated. Some interesting twists like dissolving oneself into the earth, but others, like teleporting, not original.  Archmages etc also not very original. The conspiracy of King Edward and beasts not thoroughly developed nor is why our hero was deemed such a bad guy by the king. Bad guys in general not developed much as characters.All in all, an OK read, but not nearly on the level of Tolkien or Brooks or Jordan or Goodkind.

I have accounts at two libraries and had no problem switching back and forth until recently.Not only is the app suddenly asking me to sign in again (which is fine, even though I usually don't have to, but it is saying my passwords are incorrect (they're not), and has frozen me out of even being able to enter the second libraries sign in info.It keeps bringing up the first libraries account number and won't let me delete it to enter the second's one!!Extremely frustrating, and so as of now, cannot sign in and use the app for either library!!There was nowhere to report the problem to Overdrive, maybe this will get their attention so they can fix.

I moved from Maryland where the libraries used 3M eBooks for tablets & Kindles.  I now live in Nevada and the libraries here use OverDrive.  I am very disappointed with the OverDrive app. The pages freeze when I try to go to the next page. I cannot always bring up my Bookshelf. There are times when I try to sign in it won't let me. I have to shut down the Kindle and start again. I wish I could get rid of it and try another one. Does anyone know if there is another free ebook app that I can use with my library?

Apparently you can only borrow Overdrive books from libraries at which you have a ""real"" library card; it's not really an enlarged source for an i ndividual who likes to read.  .  But you can get books, and ebooks, directly from many of the participating libraries  without going through Overdrive.  The book I wanted either is not in the form I want from my local library (which I knew already) or there's something wrong with the  ""borrow"" button -- it wasn't there.  I ended up buying the book from Amjazon/Kindle and that worked, but at a price.

Until the latest update, this app was part of my daily routine. Now it's completely worthless. In order to run the app you now are REQUIRED to have an active internet connection even though I have downloaded the entire book to my device. This means that using the app in some of the core use scenarios (on a plane, driving in the car, etc.) are now completely broken.It seems like there are potentially a couple of things going on here:A) the engineering staff doesn't have basic test cases that test for core scenarios such as off-line / no network usage.B) A program manager decide to require internet, and therefore doesn't understand the customer or the core usage scenarios (in a car, on a plane, sitting in a park).C) Overdrive is exploring monetization options and wants you to be online at all times so they can collect data about your usage or to perhaps start feeding you ads in between chapters. In the vain hope that they can be the next 'netflix' or 'spotify'.Any of these options is very disappointing. I would give it 0 stars now if I could, but 1 is as low as it goes since it is now headed to the recycle bin.

This app and sign up is IMPOSSIBLE, especially if you are trying to sign up on a Kindle with the smaller screen - you can't even read the instructions on I AM NOT A ROBOT.  And if you make an error at anytime in your sign up, then you are totally screwed!  It keeps telling you that the error you made is the only configuration that can be used.  Even if you delete and try to reinstall you can't because the previous error prevents this.  I mistakenly got my email address wrong, went back in to the set up page and fixed it, but now it says it can't send the verification page again.  What a mess! This is about the 3rd time I have tried to sign up for Overdrive in the past two years.  I will just stick with the much simpler and very, very easy to use OneClickDigital.

I had to download this app to my Kindle so that I could borrow a library book that was not in Kindle format.  The library suggested it, and said that doing so would be easier than figuring out why this one book in a series of 8 is not available in Kindle format.  In fact, Overdrive itself lists 12 titles from this author and only one is not available for Kindle.  So, I downloaded the app, and the ebook in question, and after all of the hassle of installing an Android app on my Kindle, then logging it into my library and downloading the ePub version book, I seriously think I would have been happier reading it in paperback.  But it wasn't by any means the inconvenience of getting the book open on my Kindle.  Every page or two I wanted to do something that I was used to doing with the Kindle, but the feature just was not available in the Overdrive app.  Simple things like searching within the book, marking text to make a note or share on social media, even looking things up in the dictionary or Wikipedia.  The associated dictionary is terrible (supplied by dictionary.com which also gets a 1 star review) and there are no options.  Reading the book on another device required installing the overdrive app on that device, configuring it, and  downloading the book again. The next time I have this choice I will just go ahead and buy the Kindle book, which I should have done with this one, and which I might end up doing anyhow.  So if you have some other means of reading an ebook, use it-- this app isn't worth the price.

I use the overdrive website for all my account management tasks, including evaluating and borrowing books. I find the web Overdrive functions for browsing, getting books and managing my account much easier. But what makes this app so completely useless for me is using it for reading... specifically ""epub"" books. First, the files delivered to the kindle are NOT epub, hence they can't be opened by my preferred app, Aldiko, or even FBreader. They can ONLY be read with the OMC (Overdrive media console) or by reading them in my browser. Using the OMC reader is useless because it doesn't have ANY functionality except finding word definitions. Reading a book without the ability to highlight phrases for further research or to reference later in the book, complete negates the advantages of reading ebooks. At least in a real book i can either stick a bookmark with written notes or use a highlighter pen (if i own the book). The only OMC option that allows me to use full functionally of the epub book is to read it in my browser, which comes with a whole set of other problems, like reading offline, forcing me to use up an extra tab which i may need for research,very slow navigating and burning through the battery. I wish they would add the functionality available in the web reader to the OMC book reader. But i have been waiting for them to make the change for over a year now, and still the app is useless for me.Very unhappy user. Either fix the app or give me the book in a true epub file so i can use a better reading app.

Frustating but I can see how it gives advantage to Amazon for whom I have a preference  I am a ""Prime"" member for 2013-14 there won't be a 2014-15 Too many of these types of slights of hand like the so-called Amazon lending library--cant find it cant find it a second time when I do stumble on it. Can't use the help screens because the instructions do not sync with what I have on my Kindle's screen.If you have a low threshold of frustration and have reached beyond your life time toleration for being misled, ripped-off and disappointed be wary of Amazon promises as they seem to engineer these things--full-time employees who get ""congrates,"" gain bonuses, achieve promotions by ensuring no one games the system or even get value peomised.

I downloaded Overdrive because the book I was trying to borrow required it. I then found found out that you had to read it in a browser unless you downloaded something else to allow you to actually read the book without being connected to the internet while you read it. You think you have downloaded it because you click on the option to download but it really doesn't happen. The instructions say to go to the ""menu"" where you will find the option/s you need but the options they told me to look for aren't there. It also has something to do with the difference between kindle books, ebooks & epub books. Anyway, I finally decided to read this book in pieces (14 pages in the first ""download"" until I decide the book isn't worth the effort and then I'll let it expire.And why is it that when you select ""kindle"" books in your search settings the results include ebooks & epub books. Oh, I almost forgot.....the ""cloud"" somehow gets involved in all this but that's another story. Give me a break.

Love the idea of being able to read an e-book but the program is awful.  By the way, even librarian employees sighed, nodded, and agreed.  Way too many steps for what should be reasonably simple.

So far, it works fine, but you have to know what you are doing; it is not intuitive.  The instructions are horrible.  Once you download it, you have to go to Apps in your Kindle, and then to the grid on the bottom, and go thru and load in your local library.  Then you have to register it w/ your library on line.

I would go lower if it were possible. At first I thought this app would be perfect, so many books and audio books right there on my phone. So the other day I was stuck in traffic that was going nowhere so I started the final audio book of the series I have been reading. I got a few minutes into chapter and it skipped to chapter 3. I thought it was just one of those things so, seeing as I was still still sitting in traffic I tried resetting it but the same thing happened again. When I got home I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but it still jumped from chapter 1 to 3. I tried a different book later that same day thinking maybe it was a glitch in the first book  but the same thing happened. What is happening? What can I do too fix it?I guess to be fair it was working fine till the most recent Android update to 6.0.1  Does it have anything to do with the most recent update my phone did? Any advice then, I mean it wasn't my choice the update SUCKS and even more so since since I can use the app. Granted I don't have proof it was my phone's update I am guessing.Either way I still stand by review. Zero preferably but technically one. If this ever gets fixed, I am not holding my breath, I will come back and change it.

As of xmass 2012 the app for nook is unusable for searching a title. Your able to download titles, just not find what you want.Possibly it's the local libraries trouble. The nook app is doesn't work in Cleveland Ohio December 30 2012.

I won't say it doesn't work, because it does, but you still have to run thru the authentication process at your library of choice as well as the e-publisher (Amazon, Adobe, etc.).  Basically 3 logins - so what good is the app?!I can go directly to the library's website and accomplish the same thing.  If they could streamline the process of checking out an e-book, then I could endorse the app.
